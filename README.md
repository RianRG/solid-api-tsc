A simple non functional API that contains SOLID concepts

## S: Single Dependency Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages loose coupling and modularity, making your code more maintainable and testable.

## O: Open-Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This principle allows you to add new functionality without changing existing code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

## L: Liskov Substitution Principle
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly and that your code behaves predictably.

## I: Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages smaller, more focused interfaces, reducing the coupling between modules.

## D: Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages loose coupling and modularity, making your code more maintainable and testable.
